    Title: similarity.py
    Date: 2020-10-23
    Author: Julia Ortis Sunyer
    Description:
        This program will create a similarity matrix using the multiple sequence
        alignments created in the first part of the exercise. The program will create one
        euclidian distance matrix for the identity score and one for the alignment score. 
    List of functions:
        None
